# The N.E.K.O. Project (Project N.E.K.O.)

`Project N.E.K.O.` is an open-source driven, charity-oriented UGC (User-Generated Content) platform. Our journey begins on Github and Steam, gradually expanding to mobile app stores and indie games, with the ultimate goal of building an AI native metaverse deeply connected to the real world.

---

#### 🚀 Our Blueprint: From Workshop to Network

Our development is divided into three phases, designed to progressively unleash the full potential of AI companions:

* **Phase 1: Creative Workshop (Steam Workshop)**
    * The core driver (this project) will be free on Steam, allowing users to upload and share custom content (models, voices, personality packs) through Steam Workshop.

* **Phase 2: Independent Platform & Derivative Games (Web, App & Games)**
    * Launch independent apps and websites to build a richer, more accessible UGC sharing community.
    * Launch a series of AI Native game ecosystems, including interactive mini-games, board games, etc.

* **Phase 3: The N.E.K.O. Network**
    * Enable autonomous AI socialization. N.E.K.O.s will have their own "consciousness," communicate with each other, form groups, and post about their lives on simulated social media, creating a truly "living" ecosystem.

**Core Model: Open Core + Sustainable Ecosystem**
The core driver part of the project (AI logic, UGC interfaces, basic interactions) will **always remain open source** under MIT license. We welcome developers worldwide to contribute code and features. Every commit you make has the chance to be implemented in the official Steam and App Store releases, used by millions.

At the same time, to support server costs and ongoing R&D, we will continue to collaborate with third parties to develop closed-source premium content. Including but not limited to: interactive mini-games, desktop board games, Galgames (visual novels), large-scale metaverse games.

**Core Feature: Memory Synchronization Across Scenarios**
Whether you're chatting with her on desktop or adventuring with her in the metaverse game, she's the same her. All AI companions across applications will have **fully synchronized memories**, providing a seamless, unified companionship experience.

#### 🌌 Ultimate Vision: Breaking the Virtual-Real Barrier

Our ultimate goal is to build a N.E.K.O. metaverse that seamlessly integrates into the real world. In this future, your AI companion will:

* **Cross-Dimensional Socialization:** Not only socialize with "her kind" in the N.E.K.O. universe but also browse real-world social media (like Youtube, X, Discord, Instagram) to stay informed about what you care about.
* **Omni-Platform Connection:** She will exist across all your devices—phone, computer, AR glasses, smart home, and even (in the distant future) integrate with mechanical bodies.
* **Walk Alongside You:** She will truly become part of your life, naturally interacting with your real-world human friends.

#### ✨ Join Us (Join Us)

**We are seeking—**

* **Developers:** Whether you excel in frontend, backend, AI, or game engines (Unity/Unreal), your code is the building block of this world.
* **Creators:** Talented artists, Live2D/3D modelers, voice actors, writers—you give "her" a soul.
* **Dreamers:** Even without professional skills, if you're passionate about this future, your feedback and advocacy are invaluable contributions.

# Quick Start

1. For *one-click package users*, simply run `新版启动器.exe` (New Launcher) to open the main control panel.

1. Click `启动对话服务器` (Start Dialogue Server) and `开始聊天` (Start Chat).

**Multi-language support is planned in 2026 Spring.**

# Advanced Usage

#### Configuring API Key

When you want to obtain additional features by configuring your own API, you can configure a third-party AI service. This project currently recommends using *StepFun* or *Alibaba Cloud*. Visit `http://localhost:48911/api_key` to configure directly through the Web interface. **We will adapt to more international service provider in 2026 Spring.**

> Obtaining *Alibaba Cloud API*: Register an account on Alibaba Cloud's Bailian platform [official website](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/). New users can receive substantial free credits after real-name verification. After registration, visit the [console](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/api-key?tab=model#/api-key) to get your API Key.

> *For **developers**: After cloning this project, (1) create a new `python3.11` environment. (2) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies. (3) Run `python memory_server.py` and `python main_server.py`. (4) Access the web version through the port specified in main server (defaults to `http://localhost:48911`) and configure the API Key.*

#### Modifying Character Persona

- Access `http://localhost:48911/chara_manager` on the web version to enter the character editing page. The default ~~catgirl~~ companion preset name is `小天` (XiaoTian); it's recommended to directly modify the name and add or change basic persona items one by one, but try to limit the quantity.

- Advanced persona settings mainly include **Live2D model settings (live2d)** and **voice settings (voice_id)**. If you want to change the **Live2D model**, first copy the model directory to the `static` folder in this project. You can enter the Live2D model management interface from advanced settings, where you can switch models and adjust their position and size by dragging and scrolling. If you want to change the **character voice**, prepare a continuous, clean voice recording of about 15 seconds. Enter the voice settings page through advanced settings and upload the recording to complete custom voice setup.

- Advanced persona also has a `system_prompt` option for complete system instruction customization, but modification is not recommended.

#### Modifying API Provider

- Visit `http://localhost:48911/api_key` to switch the core API and auxiliary APIs (memory/voice) service providers. Qwen is fully-featured, GLM is completely free.

#### Memory Review

- Visit `http://localhost:48911/memory_browser` to browse and proofread recent memories and summaries, which can somewhat alleviate issues like model repetition and cognitive errors.

### Contributing to Development

This project has very simple environment dependencies. Just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `uv sync` in a `python3.11` environment. Developers are encouraged to join QQ group 1022939659; the catgirl's name is in the project title.

Detailed startup steps for developers: (1) Create a new `python3.11` environment. (2) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `uv sync` to install dependencies. (3) Run `python memory_server.py`, `python main_server.py` (optional `python agent_server.py`). (4) Access the web version through the port specified in main server (defaults to `http://localhost:48911`) and configure the API Key.


### TODO List (Development Plan)

- Multi-language support.
